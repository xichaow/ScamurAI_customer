## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xichaow/fraud-chatbot.git
cd fraud-chatbot
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install flask openai
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Access the application:**
- Homepage: http://localhost:8000/
- Chat Interface: http://localhost:8000/chat

### Production Deployment

The application is configured for Render deployment with automatic GitHub integration.

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `PORT` - Port number (defaults to 8000)  
- `DEBUG` - Debug mode (defaults to False)

## How It Works

### User Journey
1. **Welcome**: Professional NAB-branded chat interface
2. **Assessment**: 4 targeted questions about payment details:
   - Who are you paying?
   - What is the payment for?
   - Where did you get the payment link?
   - Which website/platform are you using?
3. **Analysis**: AI-powered scam risk assessment
4. **Recommendations**: STOP-CHECK-PROTECT safety guidelines
5. **Follow-up**: Automatic NAB banker callback notification

### Risk Assessment Framework

**Risk Levels:**
- **LOW**: Payment appears legitimate with minimal risk indicators
- **MEDIUM**: Some concerning factors requiring additional verification
- **HIGH**: Multiple red flags indicating likely scam attempt

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Recipient legitimacy and verification
- Payment purpose and context analysis
- Source credibility of payment requests  
- Platform/website authenticity checks

### Safety Recommendations

**STOP-CHECK-PROTECT Framework:**
- **STOP**: Don't give money or information to anyone if unsure. Scammers pretend to be from trusted organizations.
- **CHECK**: Ask yourself if the message or call is fake. Never click links in messages. Only contact businesses using official website or app contact information.
- **PROTECT**: Act quickly if something feels wrong. Contact your bank immediately if you notice unusual activity or if a scammer gets your information.
