## FEATURE:

I want to build a chatbot to ask questions for customers to ensure their transaction is not scam or fraud.  these are the main four questions: payment recipient, purpose of payment, source of payment link, website verification. these questions are asked one by one. and we need to gain customers inputs to store as cache. so that we can send this information to openai api to determine whether these transaction are more likely fraud or not. if the customers' answer is not related to the question, need to paraphrase and ask again. 

## EXAMPLES:

this is the example website for ui example: https://project-payment-safety-chatbot-interface-648.magicpatterns.app

## DOCUMENTATION:

[List out any documentation (web pages, sources for an MCP server like Crawl4AI RAG, etc.) that will need to be referenced during development]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Any other considerations or specific requirements - great place to include gotchas that you see AI coding assistants miss with your projects a lot]
