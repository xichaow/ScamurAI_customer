# Project Requirements and Planning (PRP)

## Project Overview
**Fraud Investment Chatbot** - An interactive chatbot system designed to help customers identify potentially fraudulent transactions through guided questioning and AI-powered fraud detection.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Sequential Question Flow**
   - Present 4 core fraud detection questions one at a time
   - Questions: payment recipient, purpose of payment, source of payment link, website verification
   - Wait for user response before proceeding to next question

2. **Input Validation & Re-prompting**
   - Validate user responses for relevance to current question
   - Paraphrase and re-ask questions when responses are off-topic or incomplete
   - Maintain conversation flow until satisfactory answers are obtained

3. **Data Collection & Caching**
   - Store user inputs in session cache/memory
   - Maintain conversation state throughout the interaction
   - Prepare collected data for API submission

4. **AI-Powered Fraud Assessment**
   - Send collected user responses to OpenAI API
   - Receive fraud likelihood assessment
   - Present results to user in understandable format

### Technical Requirements
1. **Frontend Interface**
   - Chat-based UI similar to reference: https://project-payment-safety-chatbot-interface-648.magicpatterns.app
   - Real-time message display
   - Input field for user responses
   - Visual indicators for conversation progress

2. **Backend Services**
   - Session management for user conversations
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - OpenAI API integration
   - Response caching mechanism

3. **Data Management**
   - Temporary storage for conversation data
   - Secure handling of sensitive payment information
   - Session cleanup after completion

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React/Next.js or Vue.js
- **UI Components**: Chat interface, input forms, progress indicators
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for conversation state
- **Styling**: CSS modules or Tailwind CSS

### Backend Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js or Fastify
- **API Integration**: OpenAI SDK
- **Session Storage**: Redis or in-memory cache
- **Validation**: Joi or Zod for input validation

### API Design
```
POST /api/chat/start - Initialize new conversation
POST /api/chat/respond - Submit user response
GET /api/chat/status - Get current conversation state
POST /api/fraud/analyze - Trigger fraud analysis
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Chat System
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Implement basic chat interface
- [ ] Create conversation flow engine
- [ ] Add session management

### Phase 2: Question Logic
- [ ] Define 4 core fraud detection questions
- [ ] Implement sequential question presentation
- [ ] Add response validation logic
- [ ] Create re-prompting mechanism

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API connection
- [ ] Design fraud analysis prompt
- [ ] Implement result processing
- [ ] Add error handling for API calls

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Testing
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on reference design
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement security measures
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing

## Security Considerations
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Secure API key management
- Session timeout and cleanup
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Success Metrics
- Conversation completion rate
- Question relevance accuracy
- Fraud detection effectiveness
- User experience satisfaction
- System response time performance

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Users providing irrelevant responses repeatedly
  - **Mitigation**: Implement maximum retry limits with fallback options
- **Risk**: OpenAI API failures or rate limits
  - **Mitigation**: Add retry logic and fallback fraud assessment methods
- **Risk**: Session data persistence issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement robust session management with backup storage

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API access and quota
- Frontend framework and dependencies
- Backend runtime and frameworks
- Session storage solution
- Hosting infrastructure

## Timeline Estimate
- **Phase 1**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 1 week
- **Phase 4**: 1 week
- **Total**: 4-6 weeks for MVP

## Next Steps
1. Confirm technical stack preferences
2. Set up development environment
3. Create detailed wireframes/mockups
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Set up OpenAI API access and testing
